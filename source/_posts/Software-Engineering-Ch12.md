## Multiprocessor
- Distribute into processes
- Pre-determinated / allocate controller
## Client-server
- Model as a set of services
- Two-tier architecture
    - Thin client : client does presentation (legacy system)
    - Fat client : server manages data (off-the-shelf client)
- 3-tier architecture
    - Optimize transfer between frontend and backend
    - Extend to multi-tier architecture
## Distributed object
- Remove distinction between client and server
- System componets as objects
- Open, flexible, scalable, possible to reconfigure dynamically
- Middleware :
    - Logical communication level : CORBA, COM
    - Component level : EJB, CORBA, Active X
## Inter-Organasational distributed computing
- P2P architecture
    - Decentralised
    - No distinction
    - Impossible in practice
    - Semi-centralised
- Service-oriented system architecture
    - Service provider
    - Apps binds to services
    - Maybe pay for service
