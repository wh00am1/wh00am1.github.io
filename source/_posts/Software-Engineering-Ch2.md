## Emergent system properties
<!-- more -->
- Funcional
- Non-Functional
    - Reliability
    - Performance
    - Safety
    - Security
## Systems engineering
### Distinction with SE
- Limited scope for rework during dev
- Interdisciplinary
### Requirements definition
- Functional requirements
- System properties
- Characteristics
### System design
- Partition requirements
- Identify sub-systems
- Assign requirements to sub-systems
- Specify sub-system functionality
- Define sub-system interfaces
### System modeling
- Relationship between components -> architecture model
- illustrated in block diagram, etc
### Sub-system development
- From scratch
- Commercial, off-the-scratch (COTS)
    - cheaper
    - may not meet the requirements exactly
- Developed in parallel
### Intergration
### Evolution and Decomissioning
## Organisations, people and computer systems
### Organisational process
- COTS available:
    - Choose system
    - Choose supplier
- Custom system:
    - Select tender
    - Negotiate
    - Let contract for development
## Lagacy systems
- Socio-technical
- Bussiness-critical
- Reason for maintaining :
    - Too risky to replace
    - Change one part -> change other components
