## Software process models
<!--more-->
### The waterfall model
- Stages:
    1. Requirements analysis and definition
    2. System and software design
    3. Implementation and unit testing
    4. Intergration and system testing
    5. Operation and maintanence
- Properties:
    - Eash phase produce approved document
    - A phase can start only if previous is done
    - Costly iteration
    - Inflexible
### Evolutionary development
- Types:
    - Exploratory
    - Throwaway
- Stages:
    1. Initial implementation
    2. Expose to user & refine
    3. Finish with adequate system
- Properties:
    - Dev and V&V are interleaved
    - Rapid feedback
    - Specification developed incrementally
    - Process no visible
    - Poorly structured systems
### Component based development (CBSE)
- Stages:
    1. Component analysis
    2. Requirements modification
    3. System design
    4. Development and intergration
- Properties:
    - Based on COTS
    - Reduce cost and risk
    - Inevitable req compromise -> may not meet all reqs
## Process iteration
- Incremental delivery
    - Don't have to wait entire deliver
    - Use early increments -> gain experience to inform requirement
    - Lower risk of failure
    - Early deployed service are tested more times
- Spiral development
    - Each loop = phase
        1. Objective setting
        2. Risk assessment
        3. Dev & Validation
        4. Planning (for next loop)
    - Explicit recognition of risk
## Process activities
- Specification
- Design and implementation
- Validation
- Evolution
## The rational unified process (RUP)
- Stages
    - Inception
    - Elaboration
    - Construction
    - Transition
- Best practice
    - Develop iteratively
    - Manage requirements
    - Use component-based architectures
    - Visually model software
    - Verify software quality
    - Control changes to software
## CASE
- Automating some process activities
- Reduce costs
- Classification
    - Specification
    - Design
    - Implementation
    - V&V
- Tools
    - From planning to reverse engineering
