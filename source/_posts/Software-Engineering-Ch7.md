## Feasibility study
<!--more-->
- Check if worth carry on
- Aims to answer:
	- Contribute to overall objective of organisation?
	- Implement w/ current tech & (cost & schedule) constraint?
	- Intergrate w/ other working system?
## Elicitation and analysis
### A general spiral model
- Discovery
	- Gather info:
		- Documentation
		- System stakeholder
		- Similar system
- Classification
- Prioritization and negotiation
- Documentation
### View-point oriented
- Interactor
- Indirect
- Domain
### Interviewing
- Closed
- Open
- Not effective for eliciting
### Scenarios
- Detail
- Interactions
### Use-cases
- Individual interaction
- Sequence diagram
- Effective for eliciting
### Ethnography
- Social & organisational requirement
- Effective for discovering requirement:
	- Derives from actual way of working
	- Derives from co-ops
- May combine : prototyping
## Validation
- Checks
	- Validity
	- Consistency
	- Completeness
	- Realism
	- Verifiability
- Techniques
	- Requirements reviews
	- Prototyping
	- Test-case generation
## Management
- Enduring and volatile reqs
- Requirement managemant planning
	- Identification
		- Mutable
		- Emergent
		- Consequential
		- Compatibility
	- Change management
		- Problem analysis & change specification
		- Change analysis & costing
		- Implementation
	- Traceability policies
		- Source
		- Requirements
		- Design
	- CASE tool support
		- Storage, etc
